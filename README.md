# Simple game

The simple game environment demonstrates how to make a game for openai.
I use python3 because it is required by the openai benchmarks.

Make sure to add:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/gym-simple/
```
to ~/.bashrc if you want to import outside of this folder.

# Installation

```bash
cd gym-simple
sudo pip3 install -e .
```

# Run

```bash
python3 run_my_game.py
```
